# Cocktail-Generator
***

## General Info
This is the first group project for my coding bootcamp. I had to work with two other classmates to fulfill the following requirements:

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
* Be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input).
* Use at least two server-side APIs.
* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* Be responsive.
* Have a polished UI.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id-naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

### Technologies Used

* CocktailDB API
* Tasy API
* Materialize for the CSS
* Google fonts
* Google Draw and 3D Paint to create the logo
