## Description
This application is the first group project in my coding bootcamp. It allows the user to search for a food recipe and a drink recipe to pair with it. We used the cocktailDB API and the Tasty API. We used materialize for the CSS. My main roles were the brand logo, the initial HTML framework, and assisting with the CSS.
